# NetUF

NetUF aims to simplify email communication within educational environments by introducing a messaging system with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditional email exchanges between students, Teaching Assistants (TAs), and professors can often be time-consuming and inefficient, leading to delays in response times and potential miscommunication.

With our platform, students can easily reach out to TAs for assistance or clarification, while professors can efficiently manage and respond to inquiries that were pushed up to them.This results in emails being filtered for professors and not having a cluttered inbox. The use of AI technology allows the system to intelligently handle routine questions, such as inquiries about course materials,assignment deadlines or any other topics on the course syllabus, thereby freeing up valuable time for educators to focus on more complex tasks.
